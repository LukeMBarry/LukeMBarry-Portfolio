This folder contains presentations and plans either for hypothetical businesses or for improvements to already established companies.

All work was created with team members during my Management BBA degree (Entrepreneurship and Innovation focus) program. 

The powerpoint files are in lieu of unfortunetly not having any recordings of the presentations themselves and serve merely as proof of my ability to work in a group.
